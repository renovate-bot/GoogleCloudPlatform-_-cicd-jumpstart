Download the "Android Studio for Platform" custom image source files from:
`https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-workstations-custom-image-examples/tree/main/examples/images/android-open-source-project/android-studio-for-platform`
and place the code within `cicd-foundation/apps/asfp/` (so that the `Dockerfile` is in this directory).

You can then follow with the instructions from `cicd-foundation/infra/README.md`.
